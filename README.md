# Smart Grid Failure Prediction
A neural network approach for predicting imminent failures in a smart power grid. This repository contains raw data and simplified prediction algorithms that were discussed in the following paper:

[Koosha Marashi, Sahra Sedigh Sarvestani, Ali R. Hurson, "Identification of interdependencies and prediction of fault propagation for cyberâ€“physical systems," Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Volume 215, 2021.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.107787)

A demo of failure prediction for IEEE-14 power grid system is available [here](https://koosham.github.io/SmartGrid-Failure-Prediction).
